Project Module
==============

After creating a new kiwi42 project a default module is present within the ``modules`` folder called ``application``. If you rename it make sure to reflect this change within ``config/modules.config``.

.. tip:: For convenience: the project's main module folder should be named after the project itself and represent the namespace used for PHP classes. This usually makes it easier to reason about the modules' responsibilities.
